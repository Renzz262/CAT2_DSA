# Q1:  Big O Notation in Algorithm Analysis

The Big O notation is a way to measure the efficicency of an algorithm by describing the maximum time it might take, depending on input size. Essentially, it gives an idea of how well an algorithm handles larger datasets and how its performance changes as the input grows.

# Examples & Rules 

1. Abstracting Constants:
   When evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm, the constant factors are left out since they do not impact how quickly an algorithm's performance grows with larger inputs. For example, if an algorithm takes 3n steps, it is simplified to O(n) since the constant multiplier 3 does not afect the overall growth pattern. 

2. Dropping Lower Order Terms:
   When analyzing algorithms, only the term with the fastest growth rate matters. The lower ordered items are ignored due to them becoming insignificant as the input size increases. For instance, if an algorithm has a runtime of n² + n, it is simplified to O(n²) since n² grows much faster than n with larger inputs.
3. Worst-Case Analysis:
   Worst-case analysis with Big O notation focuses on the most challenging situations an algorithm might face. This ensures its performance remains reliable under maximum demand.An example is in a linear search, when the best case is O(1) when the target is at the start, the worst case is O(n) when the target is at the end.
   
4. Comparison of Algorithms:
   The big O notation assists us in comparing algorithms by simplifying things, ignoring details like constants. For example, an algorithm that works in  O(n log n) time is generally more efficient and faster than one in O(n²) time when dealing with significantly large inputs

5. Simplification and Focus on Asymptotic Behaviour:
The Big O notation simplifies the comparison of algorithm efficiencies by focusing on how performance scales with input size, rather than precise operation counts.
   > This abstraction helps in understanding algorithm performance regardless of hardware or implementation differences.
