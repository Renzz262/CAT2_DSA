# Q2: Differences Between Arrays and Linked Lists

Arrays and linked lists differ in several key ways. Ho they manage memory, how efficiently/smoothly they perform and how they handle adding or removing elements. Arrays use a fixed memory block and are faster when accessing elements. On the other hand, linked lists grown dynamically and are better suited for insertions and deletions.

# 1. Memory Allocation

Arrays allocate memory in a single, continuous block and have a fixed size when created. Dynamic arrays in some programming languages can resize, but they achieve this by creating a new array and copying over data.

In contrast, linked lists allocate memory dynamically for each individual node. These nodes are dispersed across memory and are connected by pointers or references to the next node.

# 2. Performance

Arrays:
  i)Access Time: Provides constant time O(1) access to elements using an index.

 ii) Insertion/Deletion: Inserting or deleting elements (especially in the middle) requires shifting subsequent elements, leading to a worst-case performance of O(n).
  
Linked Lists:
 i) Access Time: Requires traversal from the head to the desired node, resulting in O(n) time for random access.

 ii) Insertion/Deletion: Generally more efficient for operations at the beginning or when the node reference is known, as these can be done in O(1) time by updating pointers. However, finding the insertion point might still take O(n) time if a search is needed.

# 3. Insertion and Deletion Operations

Arrays:
 i) Insertion: Adding an element (especially in the middle) involves shifting elements to accommodate the new value.

 ii) Deletion: Removing an element also requires shifting elements to fill the gap.
 
  These operations are less efficient compared to linked lists when frequent modifications are required.
  
Linked Lists:
 i) Insertion: Can be performed at the beginning in constant time O(1) if you have a pointer to the head. Inserting at other positions requires locating the previous node, which is O(n) in the worst case.

 ii) Deletion: Removing the first node is O(1). Deleting a node from the middle or end also requires finding the preceding node, so it might take O(n) time.
  
To conclude, arrays offer quick random access due to neighbouring memory allocation. Linked lists on the other hand offer more insertions and deltions at the begginning or when working with dynamic data where frequent modifications are needed.
